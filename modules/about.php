				My journey to becoming a developer came in December 2019 when I stumbled across a 'Build a Simple Calculator in Javascript' turotial on YouTube. That lone tutorial lead me down a rabbit hole of watching similar videos and tutorials the rest of that night. I spent almost a year trying to self-teach myself to become a developer (after all "self-taught full stack developer is used so frequently) but realized how difficult it was to become a developer by watching tutorial after tutorial.

				In March of 2021, I enrolled in Perpetual Education's "Design for The Web" mentorship and have since been creating websites from design to deployment. Paying close attention the the design process, research and strategy, content hierarchy, typography, responsive layout techniques, user testing, and much more,  I feel I am closer to reachingmy dream of becoming a web developer.
